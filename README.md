# Solid of revolution - by MarcosJSP

The main idea behind this project is to draw a two-dimensional figure that will be our surface of revolution, and then, based on the revolution of that figure, a three-dimensional figure will be generated. 

To make it more clear, here is an visual example of what i'm talking about (2D Mode is where we draw the two-dimensional figure and 3D Mode is where the 3D figure is generated):

## Development

As you can already tell, we have 2 main screens:

- **2D Mode**

  <img align="center" src="readme assets/2D Mode.gif" alt="2D Mode gif"></img>
  <div align="center"><b>Figure 2 - 2D Mode</b></div>
  
  
    This mode is the first thing we see when we enter the program and If we divide the screen it in two halves we can see that:
  
  - The first half: Is where the current mode shows up (2D Mode in this case). It also contains all the keys and mouse short-cuts that the user can use in this mode.
  - The second half: Is where we can draw the two-dimensional figure that later will be revolutioned.
  
  

- **3D Mode**

This mode is accessed from the 2D Mode when hitting the `M key`, and here is where we can see the three-dimensional figure generated from the revolution of the two-dimensional figure.

<div align="center"><b>Figure 3 - 3D Mode</b></div>


As we can see in the **Figure 3** all the short-cuts for this mode are shown if we hit the  `H key` which will lead to a screen that looks like the **figure 4**:
